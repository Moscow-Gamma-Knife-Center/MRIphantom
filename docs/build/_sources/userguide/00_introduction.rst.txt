Introduction
============

OpenHSV is an open source system for high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV). In contrast to videostroboscopy,
with HSV we are able to see each vocal fold oscillation cycle with high temporal resolution. To not only
visualize but also quantify the vocal fold oscillation behavior, OpenHSV contains also a data analysis part
that segments the glottal area in each frame and computes quantitative parameters thereof. We further
acquire simultaneously audio signals that are synchronized to the video signal. Quantitative parameters
derived from the audio signal are also computed.

In this user guide, we provide the steps to built the system yourself.

Steps:

    #. Hardware setup
    #. Software setup
    #. First acquisition
    #. Data analysis
